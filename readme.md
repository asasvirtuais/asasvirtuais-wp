# Asas Virtuais WP

WordPress plugin developed and maintained by Icaro Asas Virtuais.

- This plugin gets updated on every push event made to this repository.
- The updates are patch releases with versioning.
- I am using composer to install plugin update checker and any other php libraries I might use.
- A Github workflow creates a zip asset and issues a new release.

**Weekly Roadmap**
